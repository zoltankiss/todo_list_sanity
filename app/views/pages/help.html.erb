<h2>Sharing Projects</h2>

<p>
  You can share projects with other people, so that both of you can add, prioritize, and
  manipulate tasks.
</p>
<p>
  To do this, you need that user's url who you wish to share project(s) with.
  This is the url you are taken to when you click on "My Profile" on your projects page.
  After you have the user's url you wish to share with, click on "share" next to the
  project you wish to share and enter the url.
